R Markdown is a document format that is available to use for HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. It allows for a clear separation between the code chunks and any narrative text.
```{r setup, message = FALSE}
# Library
library(ggplot2)
library(inline)


```

## R Markdown



```{r cars}
# Plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, fill = cyl))+
  geom_point()
```

## LaTex expression


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}


```

Reflection: I think R Markdown provides a simpler way to separate and make notes on your code chunks. In comparison with plain reports, R Markdown allows for each code chunk to be separated with a change in the background color and for any generated outputs to be visualized right below the code which is very helpful. I did run into issues trying to set up the LaTex expression though, I was not able to get the output to generate.
