# This was due to the variables within the function "myMean" not having any correlation with the "assignment2" vector that it was supposed to reference.
# Instead of "assignment2" the variable used in the function were "assignment" and "someData" neither of which have a reference point.

# Corrections
# Creating the Vector
assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)

#Forming the function
myMean<-function(assignment2){return(sum(assignment2)/length(assignment2))}

#Test
myMean(assignment2)
